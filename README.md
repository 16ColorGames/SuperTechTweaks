Want to help out?
Here is a list of tasks I'm currently working on:
* Rendering for the ore blocks (see itemOreChunk for layers and ore1-ore7 for the textures, or check out the TESR Branch)
* Dynamic hardness for ore based on ore contents
* Finish & test Cluster generation
* Fix vein generation errors (tends to escape min and max y and create "chunky" lines)
* Other generators (Have fun!)
