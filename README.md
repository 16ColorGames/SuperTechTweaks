Here is a list of tasks I'm currently working on:
* Rendering for the ore blocks (see itemOreChunk for layers and ore1-ore7 for the textures)
* Dynamic harvest level based on ore contents
* Dynamic hardness for ore based on ore contents
* Cluster generation (See vein generation for examples on how parsing and generation works)
* Other generators (Have fun!)
* TileOreBlock needs to know what block it replaced (stone, diorite, marble, etc) so that it can render properly.
